            Star of India's title-winning campaign in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2011, Gautam Gambhir has been
            named as the new head coach of the India men's cricket team.
            India have announced former opener Gautam Gambhir as the new head coach of the men's cricket team. He will
            take over from Rahul Dravid after a successful ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 campaign.

            The announcement was made by BCCI secretary Jay Shah on social media.

            "It is with immense pleasure that I welcome Gautam Gambhir as the new Head Coach of the Indian Cricket
            Team," Shah posted.

            "Modern-day cricket has evolved rapidly, and Gautam has witnessed this changing landscape up close. Having
            endured the grind and excelled in various roles throughout his career, I am confident that Gautam is the
            ideal person to steer Indian Cricket forward."

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden faced a test Thursday that he had avoided so far this year — a solo news
            conference with questions from the White House press corps.

            The news conference was meant to reassure a disheartened group of Democratic lawmakers, allies and
            persuadable voters in this year’s election that Biden still has the strength and stamina to be president.
            Biden has tried to defend his feeble and tongue-tied performance in the June 27 debate against Republican
            Donald Trump as an outlier rather than evidence that at 81 he lacks the vigor and commanding presence that
            the public expects from the commander in chief.

            He made at least two notable flubs, referring at an event beforehand to Ukrainian President Volodymyr
            Zelenskyy as “President Putin” and then calling Kamala Harris “Vice President Trump” when asked about her by
            a reporter. But he also gave detailed responses about his work to preserve NATO and his plans for a second
            term. And he insisted he’s not leaving the race even as a growing number of Democratic lawmakers ask him to
            step aside.
